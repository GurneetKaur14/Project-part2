            <h2>Delivery Policy</h2>
            <p>Local delivery of $15 will be added to each product, for each address within the local Toronto area. We are happy to offer same day delivery on most products, placed before 10:00 AM. We deliver 6 days a week, excluding Sundays with the exception of some holidays.</p>
            <p>For wire-out orders please call our shop directly. We are unable to accept international orders over the internet. Please allow 48 hours for orders overseas.</p>
            <p>Same Day Delivery: If your order is placed before noon, typically we are able to deliver the flowers the same day. For orders going outside of our local delivery area, we may require the order to be placed earlier for same-day delivery. At the holidays, due to the large volume of orders, please place your order by 2:00pm the day prior to your desired delivery date.</p>
            <p>Specific times: Our delivery time is 2pm-6pm. We are unable to guarantee specific delivery times, due to traffic, weather, the driver's route, and other factors outside of our control in this large city of ours. You may request a window of time in the special instructions box and we will do our best to accommodate your request. Please feel free to call us if you have a unique delivery situation that you would like our help with.</p>
            <p>Weekend Delivery Policy: We deliver on Saturday only. Depending on the location and timing, delivery may not be possible to certain areas on the weekend.</p>
            <p>Rural/ difficult deliveries: We are unable to deliver to PO Boxes. In some cases, rural delivery rates can be much higher than the standard delivery rate. Certain areas within Toronto are also difficult to deliver to and there could be a higher rate or no service available (ie. malls, large universities, train stations, arenas, etc.) If we are not able to deliver to these locations on a specified day we will deliver to a home address.</p>
            <p>Orders outside Our Local Delivery Area (Wire-outs): We are proud to personally deliver all over the GTA. Orders going outside the GTA or orders placed late for the GTA will be wired-out to a florist in the area and a $20 wire fee will be applied to your order. Please note, taxes may vary greatly, depending on the province/country of delivery.</p>
            <p>If no one is home: Prior to placing your order, please ensure the recipient is in town and available to receive your gift. If upon delivery the recipient is not available, the delivery person may leave the gift in a safe place for the recipient to retrieve when they return, such as on the porch or with a neighbour. We can call ahead to ensure the recipient is home if you are not sure, but we will typically only do this upon request. If we are not able to leave a message or if the recipient does not respond to our messages, we may delay delivery until we are able to get in touch. It is the responsibility of the sender to know if the recipient is in town. The Flower Nook will assume no responsibility for problems due to the recipient being out of town.</p>
            <p>Incorrect addresses: It is the sender's responsibility to ensure that the recipient's address and phone number are correct. If the recipient's address is incorrect and delivery is attempted, you will be charged for the attempted delivery as well as the delivery to the correct address. The Flower Nook is not responsible for deliveries made to incorrect addresses submitted to us by the customer. If such a delivery is made, the customer assumes responsibility for the entire purchase.</p>
            <p>Canceling an order: Same-day orders are processed immediately and usually cannot be changed. Due to the urgent nature of florist-delivered products, we are unable to cancel or change orders already in process at the florist, en route, or delivered. The customer will assume full responsibility for the purchase.</p>
            <p>Recipient may be contacted: We are happy to contact the recipient prior to delivery, but will typically do this only at your request. In some cases, the florist may contact the recipient to ensure they are home to accept the delivery. If you do not provide a local phone number for the recipient, The Flower Nook cannot be held responsible for missing or faulty product. If we do not have a way to contact the recipient, we cannot ensure they will receive their delivery. Providing your own phone number is not an acceptable replacement for the phone number of the recipient.</p>
            <p>Request to leave item at Door: The customer assumes all liability for requests to leave arrangements at the door. The Flower Nook cannot be held responsible for missing or faulty product due to this special request.</p>
            <p>Recipient Refusal or Order: If the recipient refuses to accept a delivery, it will be donated. The customer will be held fully liable for the cost of the gift.</p>
